# Stopwatch using React

I have created a stopwatch using React and Vite by following an excellent tutorial on YouTube by [ivanlourencogomes](https://github.com/ivanlourencogomes). This project is a very basic version, but it includes effective methods such as props, useEffect, and more in React, making it a great learning tool for beginners.

You can access the YouTube video [here](https://youtu.be/oyMyqBK1lg4?si=HphCDfU2TS_T-eD_).

## Features

- Displays time in hour:minute:second format
- Includes two buttons: Reset and Stop/Start
- Utilizes React hooks like useEffect and props for functionality

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- Vite.js installed on your machine
- npm as your package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stopwatch-using-react.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd stopwatch-using-react
    ```
3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:
```sh
vite
```

This will start the development server and you should see the application running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or another available port as indicated by Vite).

## Usage

- **Start/Stop Button:** Toggles the stopwatch between running and paused states.
- **Reset Button:** Resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00.

## Learning Points

This project covers basic React concepts such as:

- **Props:** Passing data between components
- **State Management:** Using state to manage the stopwatch time
- **useEffect Hook:** Handling side effects such as updating the time

## Output Images

Here are some screenshots of the stopwatch application:
